# SpringBoot
The lab "Deploying an Application with Spring Boot" introduced me to Spring Boot, a tool that simplifies the development and deployment of Java applications. It addresses the complexities of configuring libraries, managing dependencies, and deploying applications by automatically configuring components based on classpath detection and providing customization options. Spring Boot is not a framework or code generator but an integral part of a project's lifecycle, simplifying tasks like property management, application monitoring, and deployment. I created an application from scratch, focusing on generating student data, storing it in a MySQL database, and exposing RESTful web services for data queries. The workshop uses Spring Initializr, a tool that simplifies dependency management by pulling in required dependencies. This hands-on introduction to Spring Boot makes the development and deployment of Java applications more efficient and streamlined.
